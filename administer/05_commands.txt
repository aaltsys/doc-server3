The AAltSys Server provides secure shell (ssh) for remote administration at the command line.
Unixes come with ssh, or this protocol can be added to Windows with the putty package.
For that matter, putty can be added to a Linux KDE desktop with the command:

|	sudo bash < <(wget https://raw.github.com/gist/1030236/putty-kde.sh -O-)

Local workstations can connect to the server over ssh with the terminal command:

|	ssh admin1@AAltSysServer.local.aaltsys.net

The AAltSys support VPN provides connection to remote servers with a similar command:

|	ssh admin1@(registration).servers.aaltsys.net

From the Gnome desktop in Linux, a desktop start icon would use the following command
to open an x-term window and run an ssh connection to a remote server:

|	gnome-terminal -x ssh admin1@(registration).servers.aaltsys.net

Now suppose the LTSP virtual terminal server is started on a remote server. Next, at a
remote workstation configure an NX client session to connect on port  
workstation opens an ssh session to the remote server with the terminal command:

|	ssh -L8889:10.4.0.2:8888 admin1@(registration).servers.aaltsys.net

Next, use the NX Client session on the workstation which monitors port 8889.
